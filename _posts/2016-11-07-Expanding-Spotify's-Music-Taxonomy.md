I'm a fan of Spotify, and use their intuitive playlist taxonomy to find my favorite jams.  But, there have been times when the preassembled 'Workout', 'Chill', or other mood-themed playlists haven't included the artists in my rotation.  For my third Metis project, I wanted to build a playlist creator using classification models to extend Spotify's themes to the artists I like.
