I'm an avid user of Spotify, and like most users, use their intuitive playlist taxonomy to find my favorite jams.  But, there have been times when the preassembled 'Workout', 'Chill', or other mood-themed playlists haven't included the artists in my rotation.  For my third Metis project, I wanted to build a playlist creator using classification models to extend these themes to the artists I like.
